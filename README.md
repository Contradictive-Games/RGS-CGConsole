# CG Console

> CG Console is a developer console that allows you to create your own commands, and execute them from a console window or from scripts.



## Notes

This is a part of RGS (Re-usable Game Systems) that I have created to help potentially speed up game development.

Within the `Runtime/Samples` folder, there is a prefab that contains an example version of a custom Console with a working UI. If you are to use this, you can create a `ExampleConsoleSettings` ScriptableObject that allows you to drag and drop different user-created themes. 

To create this ScriptableObject just simply right-click anywhere within the Project window, and in the ContextMenu select the 'CGConsole Settings" option.

This will of course not work with a custom made console, and only work with the demo version.



## Installation

### Install via .unitypackage

Download any version from releases.

## Setup And Examples

### Setting Up CGConsole's Package Settings

CGConsole offers a few package customization options so that you can get this package to fit your needs maybe a bit better, or to also support custom command development.

To access the settings, in the toolbar you will need to select `Edit/Project Settings/CGConsole`. If there is no settings asset that already exists (there should), it will prompt you to create a new settings asset, or you can optionally right click in the Project window and select `Contradictive Games/CGConsole/Package Settings`.

The window will look like:

Default package settings and what they do:
- EnableLoggingForCommandRegistration ***(default: false)***
    - This setting will log into the console the details for when the command was being registered
- RequireInterfaceForRegistration ***(default: true)***
    - Enabling this means that any time you want any of your classes to be able to successfully register a command, you must implement the `ICommandProvider` interface
- UseCustomRegexForCommandNaming ***(default: false)***
    - This allows you to define your own custom regex string for command names. When you use the `ConsoleCmd` attribute - the command's name by default must be alphanumeric, and can contain underscores. You can however switch this to true, and define your own regex string for how commands can be named.
    - ***Warning***: This can potentially break some default console behaviors or cause undesired interactions. For instance, if you allow the `?` to be at the end of a command name, the default functionality for when you type a command with the `?` at the end it will give the command's defined description as well as the arguments required to perform the command.
- Regex ***(default: ^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$)***
    - This is the regex string that we will use to validate a `ConsoleCmd`'s name value. This can not be edited unless you toggle `UseCustomRegexForCommandNaming` to `true`.
- Default Commands ***(default: all enabled)***
    - These are some of the default commands, which you can selectively enable/disable - if you'd like to be able to define your own custom versions. As an example, the DefaultCommand `load` does not asynchronously load scenes and may override your own `load` scene command's behaviors if you keep this enabled.
    - Commands List and their functions
        - `help`
            - Lists all available commands that have been registered, so long as their `ConsoleCmd` attribute did not override the `HideFromHelpCommand` attribute to `false`. This will list both the command name, as well as the provided description
        - `clear`
            - Clears the console's current logs
        - `quit`
            - Exits the application (or play mode in the editor) fully
        - `load`
            - Loads a scene by the scene's name.
            - Format: `load {scene_name_string}`
            - ***Note: If this doesn't seem to work properly, ensure that the scene is placed within your project's scene list in the build settings***
        - `set_intkey`
            - Sets a PlayerPref key of type int to the desired value
            - Format: `set_intkey {key_name_string} {desired_value}`
        - `get_intkey`
            - Logs a PlayerPref key of type int's value
            - Format: `get_intkey {key_name_string}`
        -***The rest of the get/set key commands are the same just different types***

### Default Behaviors

The default Console has a few built-in behaviors that do not require any additional setup. 

The main one is the `?` mod. When typing any command and adding the `?` to the end of the command, it will list command's description (if provided) as well as the required argument types to successfully execute the command.

The console also offers suggestions for commands you may want to type by searching through the commands list based off your input. This does a simple lookup by character matching.


### Attribute Usage

To be able to add commands to the registry, simply add the `ConsoleCmd` attribute above the function you would like to make into a command. Functions are **not** required to be `public`. The `ConsoleCmd` attribute will require the command name, but will additionally accept a string for an optional description, as well as a boolean to mark whether you would like it to be visible in the auto-completion list, and a boolean to mark whether this command will be listed within the `help` command.

```csharp
[ConsoleCmd("example_command", 
    description: "This command will not show up in `help` or auto-completion",
    hideFromAutoComplete:true, 
    hideFromHelpCommand:true
)]
public void CommandIDontWantVisible(){
    /*
        Do something
        When typing the `help` command, this command will not be listed
        When typing in the console's input field, this command will not be listed with the other commands for auto-completion
    */
}

[ConsoleCmd("log_normal")]
public void MyExampleCommand(){
    Debug.Log("We succesfully executed the `log_normal` command");
}

[ConsoleCmd("log_number")]
public void MyExampleCommandWithArgs(int arg){
    Debug.Log($"Your number was: {arg}");
    /*
        If we were to try to execute this command either as: `log_number` without any additional args, or with an incorrect arg
        it will not succeed. So long as we provide the int when executing the command, it will work
        `log_number 5` would succeed
    */
}

[ConsoleCmd("game_state", "Log the game's current state")]
public void MyExampleCommandThatHasADescription(){
    //Log the game's state
}
```

### Registering Commands

To begin using any commands you create, you must register these commands. There's 2 ways of doing so, and it is **recommended** you use both.

#### Register All Commands

```cs
CGConsoleCommands.RegisterAllCommands();
```

This will register all `[ConsoleCmd]` attributes and their functions from all MonoBehaviors that have implemented `ICommandProvider` and are actively in the scene when this function was called. If you are utilizing the `Console` class in any way - this is called within the `Start` function.

> **NOTE:** This command will by default ***only*** register MonoBehaviors that are using the `ICommandProvider` interface. However, you can override by adding `true` as the argument and it will register any MonoBehavior whether or not it implements the interface. It is best to never override it, but it is an option. 
>> **ADDITIONAL NOTE:** If in the package's settings you set the `RequireInterfaceForRegistration`, this will be overridden and always require the `ICommandProvider` interface


#### Manually Register Commands

When manually registering commands, just do:

```cs
CGConsoleCommands.RegisterCommandsFrom(this)
```

Calling this function does **not** require the class to implement `ICommandProvider`, unless you have set the `RequireInterfaceForRegistration` setting in the package's settings to `true`.

This will register all `[ConsoleCmd]` attributes and their functions from the MonoBehavior we call this function from.


#### Registering Commands From A Class

Classes can support console commands as well, and are not required to implement `ICommandProvider`, unless you have set the `RequireInterfaceForRegistration` setting in the package's settings to `true`. 

Just ensure that you properly register that class' commands by calling the `RegisterCommandsFrom(object target)` function.


```cs
public class TestClass
{
    //Properties
    [ConsoleCmd("test_command")]
    public void ExampleFunction(){
        //Do something
    }
}


public class TestMonoBehavior : MonoBehavior
{

    public TestClass MyClass = new();
    
    private void Start()
    {
        RegisterCommandsInMyTestClass();
    }

    private void RegisterCommandsInMyTestClass()
    {
        ConsoleCommandRegister.RegisterCommandsFrom(MyClass);
    }

}
```


### Executing a Console Command

Commands can both be executed within a script and by typing the command within the `Console` input field. 

To execute a command within a script you can do:

```csharp
CGConsoleCommands.TryExecute("command_goes_here");
```

The `TryExecute` method returns a `CommandResponse` which looks like:

```cs
public enum ResponseType
{
    Success,
    Invalid,
    Info, //Generally just used for help commands
    Error
}

public struct CommandResponse
{
    public ResponseType ResponseType;
    public string Message;

    public CommandResponse(ResponseType responseType, string message)
    {
        ResponseType = responseType;
        Message = message;
    }
}
```

The `CGConsoleCommands` class handles the building of the `CommandResponse`.



## Console Usage

Implementing the `Console` is pretty simple, and it can 

The base class comes with a few useful methods. I recommend you look through the class in the `Runtime/` folder to see all of its core functionality.

Additionally, if you'd like to create your own settings - you must inherit the `ConsoleSettings` ScriptableObject, and then type cast when using any of your custom settings.



## FAQ

### What Types Are Supported For the Command's Args?

Console Commands really only work with supporting basic types like `string`, `int`, `float`, and `bool`




## Stretch

Features that are not currently in this package, but I would eventually like to add

- [ ] Support structs as console command arguments
- [ ] Support gathering commands automatically, rather than manual registration
- [ ] Add auto-complete when typing a command in Console input field
    - [X] Add suggestion box when typing a command for possible command inputs
- [x] Support non-MonoBehavior classes being able to utilize commands
